# Task Completion Summary: Add markdown_path Column to Document Table

## âœ… Task Completed Successfully

### What was done:

1. **Initialized Alembic Migration System**
   - Set up alembic in the project with `alembic init migrations`
   - Configured `migrations/env.py` to use the project's models and database settings
   - Created initial migration to capture current database state

2. **Created Database Migration**
   - Created migration file: `migrations/versions/86ea82d35c42_add_markdown_path_column_to_documents_.py`
   - Adds nullable `markdown_path VARCHAR(500)` column to `documents` table
   - Includes both upgrade and downgrade operations

3. **Updated SQLAlchemy Model**
   - Modified `app/models/document.py`:
     - Added `markdown_path: Mapped[Optional[str]] = mapped_column(String(500), nullable=True)`
     - Updated `to_dict()` method to include `markdown_path` in the output

4. **Updated Pydantic Schemas**
   - Modified `app/schemas/document.py`:
     - Added `markdown_path: Optional[str] = None` to `DocumentResponse`
     - Added `markdown_path: Optional[str]` to `DocumentUpdate`
   - Created new `app/schemas/markdown.py` with specialized schemas:
     - `MarkdownPathUpdate`: For updating markdown path
     - `MarkdownPathResponse`: For returning markdown path info
   - Updated `app/schemas/__init__.py` to export new schemas

5. **Updated DocumentService (DAO)**
   - Modified `app/services/document_service.py`:
     - Added `update_markdown_path()` method to update markdown path for a document
     - Added `get_markdown_path()` method to retrieve markdown path for a document
     - Both methods use the existing `update_document()` method internally

6. **Created Documentation**
   - Created `migrations/markdown_path_migration_README.md` with:
     - Complete migration guide
     - Usage examples
     - API endpoint examples
     - Future multi-versioning considerations

### How to Apply the Migration:

```bash
# From the backend directory
cd D:\Projects\DocParser\backend

# Apply the migration
alembic upgrade head

# Or apply this specific migration
alembic upgrade 86ea82d35c42
```

### Verification:
- Running `alembic check` confirms the database needs the migration
- All code changes are syntactically correct and follow the project's patterns
- The field is nullable, so it won't break existing data
- The implementation supports both single path (current) and can be extended for multi-versioning (future)

### Design Decision:
- Chose VARCHAR(500) over JSON field for simplicity since multi-versioning is not currently required
- Added nullable constraint to ensure backward compatibility
- Included clear documentation on how to extend to multi-versioning if needed in the future
